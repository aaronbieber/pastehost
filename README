== Deploying Pastehost.com

Install prerequisites:

 - Probably a good idea to install Rails, though it's frozen in /vendor (at
   2.3.5 at the time of this writing)
 - RedCloth (gem install RedCloth)
 - Sanitize (gem install sanitize)
   - Sanitize requires libxml2 (apt-get install libxml2-dev)
   - Sanitize also requires libxslt (apt-get install libxslt-dev)
